<h1><b>BIOS program</b></h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this guide/tutorial/explanation page, you will hopefully gain a basic understanding in how our computers operate within the first couple milliseconds of startup, as well as how to make a very simple bootloaded program that can be run off of a USB or a hard drive on nearly any computer!!!</p>
<p>This page will contain three main sections, by the end of which you should have a working bootloader program which you understand the workings of</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In order to begin, you will need a basic knowledge of assembly, and more importantly the format of the code as opposed to how to use it fully (I will go over a lot of stuff regarding using assembly in this guide). Basically, you need to know how to write assembly code, even if you don't know what it quite does yet. Additionally, we will need two programs to compile and run our code: (respectively) NASM, which you can get a release build of from <a href="https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/?C=M;O=D"> nasm.us </a>, the official site of it, and the second program is QEMU which you can get from the official site <a href="https://www.qemu.org/download/"> qemu.org </a>. I won't cover specifics of installing the programs, but be sure to arrange them in a way that the .exe files are accessible in the main project directory. Other than that, you are ready to start!!!</p>
