	Recursion originates from Math, dating back to the 1888 with Richard Dedekind used recursion in some functions that he needed for a formal analysis of the concept of natural numbers. Since then, it has been used by mathematics, computer science, and biology numerous times. Here is a good book describing recursion as well as the history of it: <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/History-Recursive-Functions-Computability-Turing/dp/0983700400">An Early History of Recursive Functions and Computability from Godel to Turing (Amazon)</a>
