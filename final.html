            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The goal of this project was to use simple algorithms to make an AI for a relatively simple game called Othello. The simple explenation of the rules to Othello --also referred to as reversi-- is as follows:</p>
        <li>Start</li>
        <p>You start the game with a 8 by 8 game board just like in chess, and place two white pieces and two black pieces in the center 4 squares in a way such that each piece is diagonal to the other piece of it's color</p>
        <li>Game</li>
        <p>Once the game is started, both players take turns placing an extra piece of their color anywhere on the board. If they place the piece in a manner such that it 'flanks' the opponents pieces, replace all the 'flanked' pieces with pieces of your color. To flank the opponents pieces is to place an extra piece such in between the newly placed piece and another previously placed piece of your own color, there are only the opponents pieces. This rule applies diagonally, horizontally, and vertically</p>
        <li>Winner</li>
        <p>Once the game board is full, the winner is determined simply by counting up the number of pieces to see who has more. Ties are not possible in this game to my knowledge, I may very well be wrong but in any case I made this project around that assumption. In the event that the board is not full and the current player has no valid moves, their turn is skipped</p>
        <li>Algorithm</li>
        <p>the algorithm i used for this project is minmaxing, which works by assuming both players play the most logical move, and looks n moves ahead taking into account all possible moves and making a decision based on that. An upgrade which i later aded to this algorithm is alpha-beta pruning, which allows the algorithm to discard moves that are guaranteed to lead to a position that is inferior to other possibly achievable positions already found.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>The site is supposed to work well so long as the url requested is generated by the page itself. If the url is tampered with it will most certainly return an error. Though i took the liberty to assume it wont be tampered with. I have fixed probably more than 10 bugs that just kept on popping up randomly popping up, so there will likely be many more critical bugs to be encountered. 90% of the time, however, the game will finish without any issue.</p>

            <h3>Play Game:</h3>
            <p>Below this is an iframe with the interactive game. The way you play the game is by interacting with this iframe, in order to be able to do so, you need to enable cgi for python on whatever web server this is hosted on. If that isn't done, the iframe below will simply download the main python file instead of interacting with it</p>
