  <p> Recursion's most practical use in the field of computer science is to break down a task that is way to big to be done (in many cases, this could be due to the task having a time complexity that scales up too fast or the task simply being too complex to be done iteratively or explicitly) into many smaller tasks that are easier to be done. An example of this is with some mathematical functions (from which recursion originated. <a href="#Origin">more on that</a>) in which: in order to find the next element, you must do some arithmetic onto the previous element(s). As an example: <p align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/Q_%7Bn%7D%3DQ_%7Bn-1%7D%2BQ_%7Bn-2%7D" alt="Q_{n}=Q_{n-1}+Q_{n-2}" /></p> is a recursive function in which in order to find each new element, you must sum the previous two (this is known as the fibonachi sequence)
